Tower Defense Game - Modified Version

Overview

This project is a modified version of the Tower Defense game template in Unity. The following changes have been made to enhance the gameplay and user experience.

Changes Made
New Enemy Type: HoverbuggxHovertank

Added a new enemy type named "HoverbuggxHovertank."
This enemy is bigger and slower than other types.
Requires 5 hits to be destroyed.
Upon destruction, it spawns a Hovertank that continues the path.
Integrated this new enemy type into all 5 levels.

Panning Mechanism Update

Changed the panning mechanism from moving the mouse pointer towards the edge of the screen to "middle mouse clicks + drag" action.
This provides a more intuitive and controlled way for players to navigate the game environment.

Scoreboard Implementation

Created a scoreboard that tracks and displays the time elapsed since the first wave starts.
The UI shows the elapsed time during gameplay.
At the end of the game, the scoreboard displays the elapsed time for each of the 5 levels.
